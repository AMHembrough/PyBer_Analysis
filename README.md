# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how ride sharing data differs by city type (urban, suburban, rural), and how those differences can be leveraged by decision makers at the company PyBer. 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
	
Total rides for each city type are as follows:
- Rural : 125
- Suburban : 625
- Urban : 1625

-	Total drivers for each city type are as follows:
o	Rural : 78
o	Suburban : 490
o	Urban : 2,405

-	Total fares for each city type are as follows:
o	Rural : $4,328
o	Suburban : $19,356
o	Urban : $39,854

-	Average fare for each city type are as follows:
o	Rural : $34.62
o	Suburban : $30.97
o	Urban : $24.53

-	Average fare per driver for each city type are as follows:
o	Rural : $55.49
o	Suburban : $39.50
o	Urban : $16.57

In addition to the above summary statistics, we also created a multiple-line graph that shows total fares for each week by city type.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on the result of the above analysis, we recommend the following: 
1.	Secure additional drivers in rural cities because there are more rides than drivers in these locations. 
2.	Secure additional drivers in suburban cities because there are more rides than drivers in these locations. 
3.	Plan for increased business during peak periods of the year, such as end of Feb when fare increases for all city types concurrently.
